                                <p class="">Education is the core value of a nation, and the function of an educational
                                        institution is
                                        not only to
                                        take care of an individual’s academic growth but also to take charge of his/her
                                        personal, social,
                                        mental, psychological, and spiritual maturity for overall learning and
                                        transformation. Only an
                                        institution which takes care of all these dynamics can shape a true scholar and
                                        a true professional,
                                        and
                                        Abasyn University is one of its kind in this realm.

                                        thriving campus at Islamabad, and one in Ras Al Khaimah, UAE which will be
                                        operational as soon as

                        <h1>Why is GDPR important?</h1>
                        <p class="p10"><span class="s1">GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how
                                        companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and
                                        process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement
                                        and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the
                                        right thing to do. At Help Scout we strongly believe that your data privacy
                                        is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices
                                        in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</span></p>
